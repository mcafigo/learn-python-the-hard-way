# Here's some strange new stuff, remember to type it exactly

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
# days creates the variable for days of the week
months = "\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"
# months creates the variable for months listed within. The \n does a line break

print("Here are the days: ", days)
# lists out the items in variable days
print("Here are the months: ", months)
# lists out the items in variable months

print("""
There's something going on here.
With the three double quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
""")

# prints out using triple quote which allows the string to keep on going
